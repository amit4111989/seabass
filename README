<h1>SEABASS</h1>

<p>Baran Balkan 2015
Seabass simulates a generic iRODS 4.1.3  environment on multiple centos6 machines  using docker containers. </p>

<p>The components are:
COPS: a postgres server that is used as the iCAT server. 
CRODS: models the IES
CABS:  models resource servers
COMS:  a centos6 machine with iCommands installed, used to talk to CRODS. </p>

<p>This project also contains bash scripts that automate the building and running of docker containers from the images defined earlier. </p>

<p>scripts that begin with the letter b are build scripts, 
and scrips that begin with the letter c are run scripts. </p>

<h1>BUILD SCRIPTS:</h1>

<p>bops.sh builds cops
brods.sh builds crods
babs.sh builds cabs
boms.sh builds coms</p>

<h1>RUN SCRIPTS</h1>

<p>cbase.sh runs Seabass as a daemon, requiring either external communication, or an exec in. </p>

<p>cint.sh runs Seabass interactively, placing the user in the terminal of COMS. </p>
